      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape
      of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened laminated
      dough.
      <br />
      Through its many evolutions, food experts and historians agree that the
      croissant has become a uniquely French pastry. The French government even
      named it as the national French product in 1920. Many other countries also
      have their own spin-offs of the croissant.
